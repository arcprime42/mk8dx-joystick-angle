# mk8dx-joystick-angle
A simple utility that helps when modding a controller for a perfect 44 degree soft drift.  
When a joystick is connected to the PC, this program continuously prints the angle as detected.

I have had success modding an 8bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth for this purpose.

Note that ExtremeRate sells a replacement shell for the Pro Controller that already has 45 degree angles built in.  
This would make a great starting point for a DIY project by reducing the amount of modification needed. Good luck!
